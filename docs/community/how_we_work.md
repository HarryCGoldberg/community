# How we work

Our most fundamental intention in this project is derive solutions to grand challenge problems that provide great value to the world. This project is an experimental and iterative constructive process along multiple parallel threads not limited to the technical one but also that regarding our community process and values.

## Getting it right

Perhaps one of the most fundamental tenants of our process is that logic should be used to make decisions and that individuals should be provided the opportunity to engage in principled discourse about any aspect of the project - technically or organizationally, current or planned. We see this tenant as necessary and naturally derived from our intention to succeed in our core project.

This tenant is necessary for several reasons. One is that when an inefficient or incorrect strategy is either not identified or not permitted to be challenged as such (whether for lack of means or indeed outright suppression) or the process of challenging it is not a dispassionate, person-independent process of purely logical discourse - such sub-optimal strategies are allowed to be implemented or to continue operating at the expense of project objectives.

Another reason the reason tenant is necessary is to continue to make clear to our members that this community is a place for their free determination; that here no rules or instructions are dispensed to members that are not open for principled debate. Providing members with such agency is necessary both to attract (and train) thinkers of this type as well as so that better solutions are found more quickly.

So welcome, members, and let your voice be heard.

## Quarter flow

Our current engineering and research process has the primary phases of proposal, planning, rounds of sprints, and mid- and end-of-quarter status checks. We see this as a minimum standard practice and indeed as per the previous accept proposals for revisions of this.

**Proposal period**: 4 weeks before the start of the quarter
**Planning and prototyping period**: First two weeks of the quarter
**Status check-ins**: Month 1, 2, and end of quarter.

### Proposal period

In the service of the reason tenant we conduct an open proposal and review process. This for example gives an opportunity for plans to be made further specific given expert input, for members to debate alternatives of high-level approach, and for high-level division of labor to be determined. The more specific a proposal can be about the technical plan that will be employed both (1) the easier it will be for reviewers to give helpful input on refining this as well as (2) lighten the burden of teams figuring this out on the fly during the quarter.

**Four weeks before**: Proposal drafting period formally begins
**Two weeks before**: Proposals are due
**One week before**: Proposal reviews are completed and returned for revisions over the following three days
**Start of quarter**: Final review and approval

Project approval is equivalent to the merging of a PR that moves a proposal draft from community/projects/proposals into community/projects/current.

### Planning and prototyping period

During the first two weeks of the quarter, we engage in a process of translating high-level proposed work first into a set of quarter-level “epics” or measurable goals and members self-assign according to these epics and consistent with the general division of labor proposed and approved during the previous period. This is to occupy up to the first week of the quarter.

During the second week, these epic groups determine an initial draft of the set of tasks that will be necessary to accomplish those goals. These are recorded as GitHub issues as assigned priority and difficulty estimates and epic teams self-allocate and individually assign these for their first sprint period. This second week of the quarter is where the process moves from the community-level to the team level - wherein communication and other overhead are minimized but within the context of a process to maintain integration (see following). Minimal prototyping during the team-level planning period can be helpful for the refinement of alternatives of approach.

### Sprints and check-ins

Following the planning period, the quarter proceeds with a series of two-week “sprints” that give teams an opportunity to both set specific short-term goals as well as to periodically pause to re-assess. Teams conduct their sprints independently but make use of GitHub issues and ZenHub tools for tracking sprints so the broader community can be generally informed of their activities.

Status check-ins are performed at the one, two, and three (end of quarter) month marks. For each of these, teams update status narrative (and if relevant, strategy) sections of their respective project working document (in community/projects/current/). Both maintaining a single source of truth as well as repeatedly returning to these is designed to help maintain alignment between activities and plan as well as remind teams to continue to update these as plans evolve.

### End-of-quarter review

At the end of quarters, project status is reviewed in the process of reviewing proposed next-quarter extensions to existing projects or if relevant planned archiving of completed projects. A PR of a project from community/projects/current to community/projects/archive is an appropriate last step for a completed project. For existing projects, the same proposal process as for new projects applies (indeed for the same reasons of providing an opportunity for discourse).

### Quarter calendar summary

The following table summarizes these phases of the quarter flow in regard to periods demarcated in units of weeks from the start of the quarter (wfs).

| Begin (wfs) | End (wfs) | Title | Summary  |
|---|---|---|---|
| -4 | -2 | Proposals drafting, submission | Teams form and prepare proposals that are versioned in community/projects/proposals. Project leaders help in integrating diversity of interested contributors and in formulating plan. Proposals are submitted by PR of proposal from /proposals/ to /current/. |
| -2 | -1 | Review. | Proposals are reviewed by reviewers and either approved outright or returned with requests for revisions. |
| -1 | -0.5 | Revisions due. | Revisions are due |
| -0.5 | 0 | Final review. | Final review and approval is performed. |
| 0 | 1 | Community-level planning | Projects are translated into set of high-level epics/measurable goals that integrate well at the project-level. Members self-assign according to epic of interest approximately consistent with proposed division of labor. |
| 1 | 2 | Project-level planning | Project teams translate epics into issues and perform estimation and prioritization concluding with allocation of first sprint and initial sprint approximate division of labor. |
| (N%2==0) | (N%2==0) + 2 | Sprint | Teams engage in sprints, continuously updating status via GitHub issues and ZenHub and continuously integrating implementations with master branch. |
| NA | 4,8,12 | Mid-quarters | Teams update project docs (in /community/projects/) including status narratives, stratgy summaries, and any relevant key results. |
| -4 | -2 | Proposal drafting | Where applicable, teams propose strategies and specific methods for how projects will be extended into subsequent quarters. |
